remember to maintain the envs and repos on perlmutter and janelia clusters
how to do better than last round, chA:
    - bicistronic screen had high false positives, possibly co-expressed genes resulted in "locked" state Y complexes.
    - longer loops for state Ys, force state X to have longer (63 and 74-7 have longer than parent, 129 only has match)
    - torsional space only for backbone generation, later relax into predictions (in torsional space?)
    - absolutely no disulfides during design >:(
    - don't over optimize on SAP

how to do better than last round, chB:
    - longer chB, all have 27 except 63 which had 21 (as opposed to 17-25)
    - charges? + C term, - N term
    -     check results of the chB order4
    - FF129 has a very polar interface, Cterm sequence is QLQKKNKKQQK
    - Some have lower helical propensity and most lower coiled-coil propensity at termini (did not quantify)
    - backside hydrophobics and aromatics may break coiled coil propensity, resurfacing to all polars sometimes seemed to cause issues (also sometimes fixed issues like in FF75) 
    -     check results of the chB order4

Strategy:
Use MPNN for sequence design after smaller sampling runs with Rosetta to sample backbones
Probably only need delta SAP and CMS/ddG/SASA for interface filtering
Start MSD sampling from designs that alphafold to single state state Y
Use MPNN for two-state sequence design after smaller sampling runs with “almost linkres” to sample backbones again
Look for complex prediction on AF2 then fold state X
Increase SAP tolerance somewhat
If disulfide stapled states are needed or wanted, just staple and predict

Pipeline:
make bound states ~180k
probably split into junctions x 1-3, non-junctions x 5-10, check lengths of non-junctions to make sure there's nothing too huge
loop, allow extension, mpnn
order chA and do SEC / expression screening 
order chB and do SEC / expression screening too?

dev TODOs:
    - add crispy kernel to ipython kernelspecs on perlmutter and janelia
    - check output pdb.bz2 files for REMARK records containing env, sha1, and seed.
    - if TMPDIR and /net/scratch and PSCRATCH don't exist, create a tmpdir in cwd with uuid for anything that has to cache temp files
    - test PAE summarization in fasta mode
    - test neighborhood vs difference only MSD with both "almost linkres" and tMPNN


TODO: 
    01 loop bound_states #0-1,2,3 adjustment per side comparison
    02 MPNN bound states
    03 fold bound states # folding.py # cluster by length?
    04 loop parents # lookup in free state df for common pdb parent, state 0? then use remodel
    05 design paired states # almost linkres in msd.py
    06 MPNN paired states 
    07 fold paired states # folding.py Y first then X.
    08 detail and filter # staple? peptide resurf? refold?
    09 order and analyze


Paper TODOs:
What will fig. 4 be:
FRET? NMR? photoswitching? negative cooperativity? 
crowdsource cool tricks, maybe ask some synbio people

crispy snippy TODOs:
fluo polarization for protease or fluorophore/quencher?
