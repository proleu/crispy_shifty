unit tests?
add submodules:
	pymatcher? could just rewrite, probably wouldn't hurt
	pompd? probably not
	mpnn: Need to ensure that the code is private to the module and not accessible from outside.
        Should work just fine as a git submodule.
	af2: ask Nater tot if there are any special considerations


how to do better than last round, chA:
bicistronic screen had high false positives, possibly co-expressed genes resulted in "locked" state Y complexes.
longer loops for state Ys, force state X to have longer (63 and 74-7 have longer than parent, 129 only has match)
torsional space only for backbone generation, later relax into predictions (in torsional space?)
absolutely no disulfides during design >:(
don't over optimize on SAP
how to do better than last round, chB:
longer chB, all have 27 except 63 which had 21 (as opposed to 17-25)
charges? + C term, - N term
    check results of the chB order4
FF129 has a very polar interface, Cterm sequence is QLQKKNKKQQK
Some have lower helical propensity and most lower coiled-coil propensity at termini (did not quantify)
backside hydrophobics and aromatics may break coiled coil propensity, resurfacing to all polars sometimes seemed to cause issues (also sometimes fixed issues like in FF75) 
    check results of the chB order4


crispy shifty TODOs
generally:
Use MPNN for sequence design after smaller sampling runs with Rosetta to sample backbones
Start MSD sampling from designs that alphafold to single state state Y
Use MPNN for two-state sequence design after smaller sampling runs with “almost linkres” to sample backbones again
Look for complex prediction on AF2 then fold state X
Increase SAP tolerance somewhat
Probably only need delta SAP and CMS/ddG/SASA for interface filtering
If disulfide stapled states are needed or wanted, just staple and predict

specifically:
make bound states ~180k
design interfaces on boinc ~? filter with standard interface stuff
TODO: probably split into junctions x 1, non-junctions x 5-10, check lengths of non-junctions to make sure there's nothing too huge
TODO: scaffold NBs extend helix, 01 loop bound_states 02 MPNN bound states 03_ fold bound states 04 loop parent 05 msd 06 MPNN msd 07 fold msd 08 detail 09 order
loop, allow extension, filter by trying to loop parent to match then loop design
mpnn or rosetta interface design? 
AF2 interfaces, make pairs for those that form interfaces
test neighborhood vs difference only MSD with both "almost linkres" and tMPNN
AF2 interfaces again, then AF2 the monomers that pass
order chA and do SEC / expression screening # TODO order chB and do SEC / expression screening too?


PAPER TODOS
What will fig. 4 be:
FRET? NMR? photoswitching? negative cooperativity? 
crowdsource cool tricks, maybe ask some synbio people

fluo polarization for protease or fluorophore/quencher?
