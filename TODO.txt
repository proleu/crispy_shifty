remember to maintain the envs and repos on perlmutter and janelia clusters
how to do better than last round, chA:
    - bicistronic screen had high false positives, possibly co-expressed genes resulted in "locked" state Y complexes.
    - longer loops for state Ys, force state X to have longer (63 and 74-7 have longer than parent, 129 only has match)
    - torsional space only for backbone generation, later relax into predictions (in torsional space?)
    - absolutely no disulfides during design >:(
    - don't over optimize on SAP

how to do better than last round, chB:
    - longer chB, all have 27 except 63 which had 21 (as opposed to 17-25)
    -     check results of the chB order4
    - charges? + C term, - N term
    -     check results of the chB order4
    - FF129 has a very polar interface, Cterm sequence is QLQKKNKKQQK
    - Some have lower helical propensity and most lower coiled-coil propensity at termini (did not quantify)
    - backside hydrophobics and aromatics may break coiled coil propensity, resurfacing to all polars sometimes seemed to cause issues (also sometimes fixed issues like in FF75) 
    -     check results of the chB order4

Strategy:
Use MPNN for sequence design after smaller sampling runs with Rosetta to sample backbones
Probably only need delta SAP and CMS/ddG/SASA for interface filtering
Start MSD sampling from designs that alphafold to single state state Y
Use MPNN for two-state sequence design after smaller sampling runs with “almost linkres” to sample backbones again
Look for complex prediction on AF2 then fold state X
Increase SAP tolerance somewhat
If disulfide stapled states are needed or wanted, just staple and predict

Back of the napkin numbers:
    ~2100 non-junctions
    *~17=34000 bound states,
    *75=2.6M designed bound states,
    *~.25=640k folded bound states,
    *~.5=320k paired bound states,
    *37=11.8M designed paired bound states,
    *~.05=592k folded paired bound states, (Y)
    *~.33=195k folded paired bound states, (X)
	TODO

    ~44000 junctions


loop, allow extension, mpnn
order chA and do SEC / expression screening 
order chB and do SEC / expression screening too?

dev TODOs:
    - fix MPNN API !!!
    - repredict AF2 intial guess folding.py the FF63-129 and cs_0-108 and JHB1-13
    - compare one more time DHR82 with FF74 (seq length difference)
    - finalize env.yml (pip install typing-extensions==3.10.0.2) and build envs on digs, and janelia
        - do it when no one is has crispy env active
    - add crispy kernel to ipython kernelspecs on janelia
    - test python interpreter finding with git root on janelia
    - fix mpnn_seq entries in scores when the decoys are being generated from folding.py
    - test neighborhood vs difference only MSD with both "almost linkres" and tMPNN

    - Example notebooks for MPNN and superfold in crispy_shifty/examples
        - finish mpnn_example.ipynb with Abbas?
    	- test folding with single pdb no fasta, pdb+fasta, and ...? TODO 

    - if really bored, add documentation to the InsertResMover and PR

    - DOTFILES - check init.vim is working, then version control
    - change crispy_shifty.plotting.utils.py to crispy_shifty.utils.plotting.py ; let Adam know
    - rebalance states/parents after 03_fold or just go crazy?
    - X Y splitting functions for 06

Paper TODOs:
What will fig. 4 be:
FRET? NMR? photoswitching? negative cooperativity? 
crowdsource cool tricks, maybe ask some synbio people
use symbolic regression on flexdock trajectory datasets? 
networks learn to summarize rules about biophysical mechanics, 
then we use a seperate layer to regress equations

crispy snippy TODOs:
fluo polarization for protease or fluorophore/quencher?
