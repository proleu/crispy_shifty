unit tests?
add submodules:
	pymatcher?
	pompd?
	mpnn?
	af2?


how to do better than last round, chA:
longer loops for state Ys, force state X to have longer (63 and 74-7 have longer than parent, 129 only has match)
torsional space only for backbone generation, later relax into predictions (in torsional space?)
absolutely no disulfides during design >:(
don't over optimize on SAP
how to do better than last round, chB:
longer chB, all have 27 except 63 which had 21 (as opposed to 17-25)
charges? + C term, - N term
backside hydrophobics and aromatics may break coiled coil propensity, resurfacing to all polars sometimes seemed to cause issues (also sometimes fixed issues like in FF75)



crispy shifty TODOs
make bound states ~160k
design interfaces on boinc ~? filter with standard interface stuff
loop, allow extension, filter by trying to loop parent to match then loop design
mpnn or rosetta interface design? 
AF2 interfaces, make pairs for those that form interfaces
test neighborhood vs difference only MSD with both "almost linkres" and tMPNN
AF2 interfaces again, then AF2 the monomers that pass
order chA and do SEC / expression screening # TODO order chB and do SEC / expression screening too?


PAPER TODOS
What will fig. 4 be:
FRET? NMR? photoswitching? negative cooperativity? 
crowdsource cool tricks, maybe ask some synbio people

fluo polarization for protease
