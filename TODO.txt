TODO: refold the resultant no_cys variants to check that they're ok?  
TODO: install conda into the crispy env?

PAPER TODOS

copper DEER test ff74 single sites -> order chimeras -> Maxx
ff129 DEER -> Maxx
clonal genes for cs_1-120 -> SEC binding, fluo polarization
DEER genes for cs_1-120 -> Maxx # maybe copper?
xtal attempts for cs_1-120

What will fig. 4 be? 

FRET? NMR? photoswitching? negative cooperativity? 
crowdsource cool tricks, maybe ask some synbio people
