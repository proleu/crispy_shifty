remember to maintain the envs and repos on perlmutter and janelia clusters
how to do better than last round, chA:
    - bicistronic screen had high false positives, possibly co-expressed genes resulted in "locked" state Y complexes.
    - longer loops for state Ys, force state X to have longer (63 and 74-7 have longer than parent, 129 only has match)
    - torsional space only for backbone generation, later relax into predictions (in torsional space?)
    - absolutely no disulfides during design >:(
    - don't over optimize on SAP

how to do better than last round, chB:
    - longer chB, all have 27 except 63 which had 21 (as opposed to 17-25)
    -     check results of the chB order4
    - charges? + C term, - N term
    -     check results of the chB order4
    - FF129 has a very polar interface, Cterm sequence is QLQKKNKKQQK
    - Some have lower helical propensity and most lower coiled-coil propensity at termini (did not quantify)
    - backside hydrophobics and aromatics may break coiled coil propensity, resurfacing to all polars sometimes seemed to cause issues (also sometimes fixed issues like in FF75) 
    -     check results of the chB order4

Strategy:
Use MPNN for sequence design after smaller sampling runs with Rosetta to sample backbones
Probably only need delta SAP and CMS/ddG/SASA for interface filtering
Start MSD sampling from designs that alphafold to single state state Y
Use MPNN for two-state sequence design after smaller sampling runs with “almost linkres” to sample backbones again
Look for complex prediction on AF2 then fold state X
Increase SAP tolerance somewhat
If disulfide stapled states are needed or wanted, just staple and predict

    ~44000 junctions


loop, allow extension, mpnn
order chA and do SEC / expression screening 
order chB and do SEC / expression screening too?

dev TODOs:
    - compare one more time DHR82 with FF74 (seq length difference)
    - extend loop_remodel based on docstring TODO
    - finish and test pair_bound_states 
    - finalize env.yml (pip install typing-extensions==3.10.0.2) and build envs on digs, perlmutter, and janelia
    - add crispy kernel to ipython kernelspecs on janelia
    - test python interpreter finding with git root on janelia
    - run_superfold_devel.py needs to work with turbo, initial guess, fasta and reference pdb all at once
    	- test with single pdb no fasta, pdb+fasta, and ...? TODO
    - Use if elif elif else tmpdir construction for mpnn and loop_remodel? 
    - test neighborhood vs difference only MSD with both "almost linkres" and tMPNN

    - Example notebooks for MPNN and superfold in crispy_shifty/examples
        - finish mpnn_example.ipynb with Abbas?

    - if really bored, add documentation to the InsertResMover and PR
