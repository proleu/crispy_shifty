Strategy:
Probably only need delta SAP and CMS/ddG/SASA for interface filtering
Increase SAP tolerance somewhat
If disulfide stapled states are needed or wanted, just staple and predict

Back of the napkin numbers:
    ~2100 non-junctions
    *~17=34000 bound states,
    *75=2.6M designed bound states,
    *~.25=640k folded bound states,
    *~.5=320k paired bound states,
    *37=11.8M designed paired bound states,
    *~.05=592k folded paired bound states, (Y)
    *~.33=195k folded paired bound states, (X)
	TODO
    ~44000 junctions

dev TODOs:
    - loop instead of 21 repeats in 00_design
    - remember to maintain the envs and repos on perlmutter and janelia clusters
    - Example notebooks for MPNN and superfold in crispy_shifty/examples
        - examples 2-4 with Abbas
            - show prototyping best practices
            - then figure out smooth setup
            - share with lab
    	- test folding with single pdb no fasta, pdb+fasta, and ...? TODO 
            - fix Abbas superfold submodule
            - get sudo access to superfold to add others
            - repredict AF2 intial guess folding.py the FF63-129 and cs_0-108 and JHB1-13
    - finalize env.yml (pip install typing-extensions==3.10.0.2) and build envs on digs, and janelia
        - do it when no one is has crispy env active
    - add crispy kernel to ipython kernelspecs on janelia
    - test python interpreter finding with git root on janelia
    - TODOs and docstrings in all modules - beta_nov16 notices in docstrings where used.
    - TODO relaxscript options for design
    - TODO option to return best decoys for each design in folding.py
    - change crispy_shifty.plotting.utils.py to crispy_shifty.utils.plotting.py ; let Adam know
    - dask dataframe implementation in folding notebooks

    - if really bored, add documentation to the InsertResMover and PR

    - DOTFILES - check init.vim is working, then version control
    - rebalance states/parents after 03_fold or just go crazy?

Paper TODOs:
use symbolic regression on flexdock trajectory datasets? 
networks learn to summarize rules about biophysical mechanics, 
then we use a seperate layer to regress equations
